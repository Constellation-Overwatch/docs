```bash
# Using Task (recommended)
task tui

go run ./cmd/microlith/main.go --tui

# Built binary
./constellation-overwatch --tui

## Dashboard Layout

The TUI displays four monitoring panels in a grid layout:

## Panel Reference

### System Metrics

Displays real-time resource utilization with visual gauges:

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **CPU** | Current CPU utilization percentage |
| **MEM** | Allocated memory in MB/GB |
| **GOR** | Number of active goroutines |
| **UP** | Server uptime since start |

### Workers

Shows health status of background workers:

| Badge | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `[OK]` (green) | Worker is healthy |
| `[ERR]` (red) | Worker health check failed |

Monitored workers include EntityWorker, TelemetryWorker, CommandWorker, and EventWorker.

### Logs

Scrollable viewport displaying application logs with color-coded levels:

| Level | Color | Badge |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| DEBUG | Cyan | `[DBG]` |
| INFO | Green | `[INF]` |
| WARN | Yellow | `[WRN]` |
| ERROR | Red | `[ERR]` |

The log buffer retains up to 500 entries and auto-scrolls to new logs when at the bottom.

### Entities

Toggleable view showing either connected entities or NATS stream statistics:

**Entities View:**
- Displays entity name, type, organization, and live status
- Entities are marked `LIVE` if telemetry was received within 30 seconds

**Streams View:**
- Shows NATS stream statistics including message count, consumers, and storage

Press `t` while focused on this panel to toggle between views.

## Terminal Requirements

For optimal display:

- **Size**: 120x40 characters minimum
- **Unicode**: Required for box-drawing characters
- **True Color**: Recommended for proper color rendering

### Recommended Terminals

- iTerm2 (macOS)
- Alacritty
- Windows Terminal
- Kitty

## Troubleshooting

### Garbled Characters

Your terminal may not support Unicode box-drawing characters. Switch to a modern terminal emulator.

### Missing or Wrong Colors

Enable true color in your terminal settings or set `COLORTERM=truecolor` environment variable.

### Truncated Content

Resize your terminal to at least 120x40 characters.

### No Workers Displayed

Wait for server initialization to complete. Workers register during the boot sequence.
