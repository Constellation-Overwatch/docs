# Aero Arc Relay

MAVLink relay bridge that connects UAVs and ground control stations to Constellation Overwatch.

## Overview

[Aero Arc Relay](https://github.com/Constellation-Overwatch/aero-arc-relay2constellation) provides a bridge between MAVLink-compatible flight controllers and Constellation Overwatch's data fabric, enabling real-time telemetry streaming from drones and autonomous vehicles.

## Features

- **MAVLink Protocol Support** - Full MAVLink v2 protocol compatibility
- **Real-time Telemetry** - Stream position, attitude, and sensor data
- **Bidirectional Communication** - Send commands back to vehicles
- **Multi-vehicle Support** - Connect multiple UAVs simultaneously

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Constellation-Overwatch/aero-arc-relay2constellation.git
cd aero-arc-relay2constellation

# Build and run
go build -o aero-arc-relay
./aero-arc-relay
```

## Configuration

Configure the relay to connect to your Constellation Overwatch instance:

```yaml
constellation:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080
  token: your-api-token

mavlink:
  connection: serial:///dev/ttyUSB0:57600
  system_id: 1
```

## Telemetry Data

The relay streams the following telemetry to Constellation:

| Data Type | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Position | GPS coordinates (lat, lon, alt) |
| Attitude | Roll, pitch, yaw angles |
| Velocity | Ground speed and vertical speed |
| Battery | Voltage, current, remaining capacity |
| Status | Armed state, flight mode, health |
