# Vision AI

Real-time video intelligence and object detection integration for Constellation Overwatch.

## Overview

[Vision2Constellation](https://github.com/Constellation-Overwatch/vision2constellation) provides AI-powered video analysis capabilities, enabling real-time object detection, tracking, and classification at the edge.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection** - Low-latency object detection on video streams
- **Edge Processing** - Run inference directly on edge devices
- **Custom Models** - Support for custom YOLO and other detection models
- **Event Streaming** - Push detection events to Constellation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Constellation-Overwatch/vision2constellation.git
cd vision2constellation

# Install dependencies and run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Supported Models

| Model | Use Case |
| ----- | -------- |
| YOLOv8 | General object detection |
| YOLOv8-seg | Instance segmentation |
| Custom | Domain-specific detection |

## Integration

Detection events are streamed to Constellation Overwatch in real-time:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "entity_id": "drone-001",
  "detections": [
    {
      "class": "person",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "bbox": [100, 200, 150, 300]
    }
  ]
}
```
