# Mission & Vision

## Our Mission

Constellation Overwatch is a project focused on **accelerating and enabling American dynamism** by being **cheaper, better, and faster**.

We are uniquely aware of not only the long-term costs and risks to R&D and ROI for Strategic Reindustrialization projects, but also the Software licensing costs that restrict rapid response for commanders and operators to effectively mobilize and have an equitable chance against the big players.

## Why Open Source Matters

<Callout type="info">
  Open source is not just a development model—it's a strategic advantage for national security and industrial competitiveness.
</Callout>

Traditional defense and industrial software carries prohibitive licensing costs that:

- **Limit accessibility** for smaller operators and innovators
- **Slow down iteration** with lengthy procurement cycles
- **Create vendor lock-in** that stifles innovation
- **Restrict rapid deployment** in time-critical scenarios

## Strategic Reindustrialization

Constellation Overwatch supports the broader mission of Strategic Reindustrialization by providing:

| Capability | Impact |
| ---------- | ------ |
| **Edge-first architecture** | Reduces infrastructure costs and latency for distributed operations |
| **Air-gapped deployment** | Full operational capability without external dependencies |
| **Modular integration** | Works with existing systems without costly overhauls |
| **Open standards** | No vendor lock-in, preserving long-term flexibility |

## Join the Mission

We believe that the future of American industrial and defense capability depends on accessible, high-quality open source infrastructure. Constellation Overwatch is our contribution to that future.
